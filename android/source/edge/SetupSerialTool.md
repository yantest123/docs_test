title: Setup Serial Debugging Tool
---

## Edge-V
You won't need an Edge-IO board to setup the serial debugger on an Edge-V. Just use the on-board GPIO pins, as shown in this picture (same as VIM1, VIM2, and VIM3).

## Edge
If you're using an Edge SBC, continue reading below:

## Preparation
- [x] A Serial Debugging Tool. In this guide, we will use a USB to TTL Converter. Ensure that it supports the `1500000` baudrate.
- [x] Edge needs the Edge-IO breakout-board to support serial debugging.

## Connections
Follow these steps to make the correct connections:

1) Connect Edge-IO board to Edge via the FPC connector.

2) Connect all the GPIOs, and check that the Tx / Rx Pins are connected correctly:

  * Tool Pin `GND`: <---> Edge IO `GND`
  * Tool Pin `TXD`: <---> Edge IO `RXD`
  * Tool Pin `RXD`: <---> Edge IO `TXD`

The connections should look like this:

3) Insert the USB-end into your Host-PC.

## Setup Kermit Protocol (C-Kermit)

**Install c-kermit:**

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install ckermit
```

**Add Access Permission**
```sh
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $(whoami)
```

**Add the following contents into ~/.kermrc to finish the setup:**

```
set line /dev/ttyUSB0
set speed 1500000
set carrier-watch off
set handshake none
set flow-control none
robust
set file type bin
set file name lit
set rec pack 1000
set send pack 1000
set window 5
c
```
## Enable 1500000 baudrate
To enable `1500000` baudrate, you need to replace the `kermit` binary. See [Khadas Kermit](https://dl.khadas.com/Tools/kermit) to download, and execute the following commands:

```sh
$ chmod +x kermit
$ sudo cp kermit /usr/bin/kermit
```

**Run the command `kermit` to launch C-Kermit**

Ensure that you have made the right connections, and if everything went fine, terminal will print this out:

```sh
$ kermit
Connecting to /dev/ttyUSB0, speed 1500000
 Escape character: Ctrl-\ (ASCII 28, FS): enabled
Type the escape character followed by C to get back,
or followed by ? to see other options.

...

```

{% note info Tip %}

If the print-out contains the following line, you might need to check the step `Add Access Permission` above.
```
/dev/ttyUSB0: Permission denied
```

## SecureCRT Bug

If you use SecureCRT to connect the Edge-V or edge,maybe you will see this.
![SrcureCRT BUG](/android/images/edge/SourceCRT_BUG.png)
This is not caused by incorrect settings. This is a CRT bug. You need to follow my steps.
* Use kermit to connect you board,you will see the true log
* Close kermit,then use SecureCRT to connect you board.you will find all is fine.

{% note info Note %}
If these steps don't work, maybe you need to confirm your settings first.
