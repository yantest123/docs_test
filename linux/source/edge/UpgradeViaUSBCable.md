* Download the [AndroidTool_Release_en_v2.71](https://dl.khadas.com/Tools/AndroidTool_Release_en_v2.71.zip) and extract it.
* `AndroidTool.exe` is the burning tool, you don't need to install it.

### Upgrading Steps

Make sure that you have installed the correct USB drivers, then follow these steps to upgrade:

1. Open `AndroidTool.exe`, click `Upgrade Firmware-->Firmware` to choose an image for Edge.

2. Connect Edge and PC with a USB-C data-cable (Edge will power-on automatically).
3. Let Edge [enter into Upgrade Mode](/linux/edge/HowtoBootIntoUpgradeMode.html) to complete the upgrading.
4. Your PC should have found your Edge device as a connected USB device, if you had correctly followed the instructions above.
* Loader Mode:

* Maskrom Mode:

If the board is upgraded from `android 7.1` to `android 9.0 ` firmware or the board is upgraded from `android 9.0` to `android 7.1 ` firmware, 
which requires `erasing Flash`.
* Erasing Flash Mode:
